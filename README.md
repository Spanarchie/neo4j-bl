# Hands on build your first Neo4j app for Java developers

The British Library have released over a million images into the public domain. The images contain maps, geological diagrams, beautiful illustrations, comical satire, illuminated and decorative letters, colourful illustrations, landscapes, wall-paintings and more.

You can read more about the project in [their blog post](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2013/12/a-million-first-steps.html)

We're going to working with [a data set containing meta data around these images](https://github.com/BL-Labs/imagedirectory). You can download the data set by running the following script:
