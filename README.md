We're going to working with [a data set](https://github.com/BL-Labs/imagedirectory) released by the British Library

You can read more about the project in [a British Library blog post](http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2013/12/a-million-first-steps.html)

In summary the British Library have released over a million images into the public domain. The images contain maps, geological diagrams, beautiful illustrations, comical satire, illuminated and decorative letters, colourful illustrations, landscapes, wall-paintings and more.

Today we'll be working with the meta data around these images. You can download the data set by running the following script:
